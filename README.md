# febrl - freely extensible biomedical record linkage

This is a port of Peter Christen and Tim Churches febrl from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/febrl).

The orginal documentation hosted by the Australian National University can be found [here](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Christen/Febrl/febrl-0.3/febrldoc-0.3/).

This fork is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the original febrl, with the following changes:

* Refacored to support Python 3
* Added requirements and setup to allow usage as a package
